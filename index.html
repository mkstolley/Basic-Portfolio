      <p>Hello my name is Matthew and this is my porfolio. I'm studying coding in the UCF Full Stack bootcamp and hope to become a Web Developer. I have spent a lot of time with computers working whether its from working IT, coding or building custom PCs.  I've also developed a lot of work place skills and teamwork with my retail management experience.</a></p>
      <p>Computers are one of my favorite things to be around at work or in my free time but I have other passions too. I'm a basketball fanatic who played from grade school up to college and I'm a lifelong Miami Heat fan! I love to longboard and skateboard although I'm actually better at building a board than riding...</a></p>
